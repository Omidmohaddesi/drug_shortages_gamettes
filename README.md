# Drug Shortages Gamettes
Gamettes are short game-based experiments that help collecting data on human decision making in a pharmaceutical supply chain for studying drug shortages. We designed Gamettes using [StudyCrafter](https://studycrafter.com/) a platform where users can easily create, play, and share gamified projects. For more information about the desing and application of Gamettes please refer to our CHI'2020 paper "[Introducing Gamettes: A Playful Approach for Capturing Decision-Making for Informing Behavioral Models](https://dl.acm.org/doi/abs/10.1145/3313831.3376571)"
